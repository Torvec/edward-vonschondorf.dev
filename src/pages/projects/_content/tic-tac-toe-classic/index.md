A simple and clean implementation of the classic 3x3 Tic Tac Toe game, built with JavaScript and rendered directly in the browser. Take turns placing Xs and Os with a friend on the same device. It’s as straightforward as it gets—quick to load, easy to play, and ideal for a bit of casual fun.

### How to Play

Click on any empty square to place your mark (X or O). The game alternates automatically between the two players. First to three in a row wins.
