A browser-based version of Ultimate Tic Tac Toe—a strategic twist on the original game. Instead of a single grid, you’ll play on a 3x3 board made up of nine smaller Tic Tac Toe grids. Each move determines where your opponent must play next, turning simple choices into tactical decisions. Play locally with a friend and see who can master the meta-board.

### How to Play

- Click a square in one of the smaller boards to make your move.
- Your move determines the board your opponent must play in next.
- Standard win rules apply—get three in a row on the _main_ board by winning individual boards.

### Development
